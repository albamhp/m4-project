function [pts3D] = triangulate(P0, P1, pts0, pts1, imgsizes)

%   Function triangulate.m that performs a triangulation
%   with the homogeneous algebraic method (DLT)
%
%       The entries are (x1, x2, P1, P2, imsize), where:
%           - x1, and x2 are the Euclidean coordinates of two matching 
%             points in two different images.
%           - P1 and P2 are the two camera matrices
%           - imsize is a two-dimensional vector with the image size
